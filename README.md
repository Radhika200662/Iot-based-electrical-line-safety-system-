The IoT-based Electrical Line Safety System ensures  safety of linemen by monitoring and controlling power lines remotely. It uses IoT technology to detect line status, send real-time alerts, and control circuit breakers through password-protected relay. This system prevents accidental electrocution and enhances maintenance safety and efficiency.
